# User story title: Login/ Signup

Keep any other version here as well, e.g. Display current deals, Let user to click on "show-current-deals".

## Priority: 10

## Estimation: 3 days

- Tuan: 4 day (e.g. estimated before iteration-1)
- Andre: 3 days
- Arkar: 3 days

## Assumptions (if any):

## Description:

The interface provides users with options to either log in or sign up for a new account. Located at the top right corner of the screen, there are two buttons available for user interaction:

- Sign up: This option is intended for new users who wish to create an account.
- Login: This option is for individuals who already have an existing account and want to log in.
  (Note: Initially, the plan was to use only JCU email for registration, but due to delays in receiving confirmation emails (which took approximately 10-15 minutes), we have decided to use Gmail for the verification process instead.)
